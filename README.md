# Stop Hallucinations: Using RAG with Your Own Documents

### Simple process of building a RAG pipeline with open source tools.


## The Problem 
Large Language Models(LLMs) like GPT are definitely powerful, but they have some critical limitations like,
1. They do not have access to our private data or documents, so they cannot answer queries regarding these.
2. They are not aware of recent updates, their knowledge is limited, so they cannot answer anything about current affairs of any field.
3. And when they dont know answers they sometimes hallucinate, producing factually wrong answers confidently.

We can think of fine tuning LLMs on every current or private or domain specific data to fix the problem, but it is very expensive, time consumingand not practical for the informations that is constantly changing or sensitive. Here RAG comes as a Game Changer!


## What is RAG?
Retrieval Augmented Generation(RAG) is a simple yet powerful idea. It helps us not to rely only on what model remembers but also feed our external knowledge to it at query time or runtime. 

It combines information retrieval with text generation or other queries. Below is the basic pipeline:
1. Indexing -> chunking and embedding the documents or information sources into vector database
2. Retrieval -> fetching most relevant chunks at runtime
3. Augmentation -> merging retrieved chunks with user's query
4. Generation -> Passing the enriched prompt to the LLM for a grounded response(answer grounding)

This makes RAG as lightweight and pratcical alternative for fine tuning. Its cheaper, secure and accurate.


## Example Implementation with open source tools or services
We shall use : 
- LangChain -> For setup
- Transformers -> Open source embeddings (here all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
- FAISS -> Vector DB for semantic search (we can use PineCone too)
- PyPDFLoader -> to intake PDFs content

Working: 
- Each chunk is turned to embedding vector
- FAISS does similarity search to find relevant context
- retriver passes it to LLM(gemini here)
- LLM gives grounded answers using retrieved knowledge.

## Key Benifits of using RAG
- Works with our local data
- To get up to date info, just add new info, nor retraining or finetuning
- Fewer hallucinations now as respones are grounded
- Cost free, no expensive fine tuning
- We can extend this to production level

Production level RAG often includes, Ingestion from multiple sources, metadata filtering for more effectiveness, intelligent agents that decide whetehr to retrieve or generate and guardrails thet help in giving safe and structured reponses. 

## Closing
RAG is more like a backbone of GenAI apps. The pipeline workflow is reliable upto production scale, which makes RAG flexible to use in healthcare, law, finance and in other reaearch works. 

### RAG grants context, accuracy and trustworthness to LLMs!
